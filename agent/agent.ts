  // Model comparison (see pnpm eval, the evals/ directory):
  // - devstral-latest (original): Mistral's agentic-coding model, not a
  //   generalist reasoner. Root cause of a class of arithmetic/narrative-
  //   bias bugs (e.g. asserting "expenses decreased" for a period where
  //   they clearly increased, even after being shown the correct
  //   subtraction).
  // - mistral-large-latest: hit persistent "Rate limit exceeded" on this
  //   API key even at eval --max-concurrency 1 — not usable with the
  //   current credentials, likely a paid-tier-only model this key isn't
  //   provisioned for.
  // - mistral-small-latest: no rate-limit issues, but behaviorally
  //   inconsistent — evals/anomaly-category-filter.eval.ts failed roughly
  //   half the time across repeated runs (sometimes returns zero anomalies
  //   for a category pair that demonstrably has some in the seeded data).
  // - mistral-medium-latest: passes the full eval suite consistently,
  //   including the arithmetic-safety regression test, and gave a noticeably
  //   better answer on an open-ended reasoning question (correctly
  //   identified both recurring Cloud Infrastructure spikes with exact
  //   figures, vs. Devstral's vaguer "may recur occasionally"). But this
  //   account's per-model rate limits (visible on the Mistral console) show
  //   the "-latest" alias metered separately from, and far more tightly
  //   than, the dated snapshot behind it: mistral-medium-latest sits at
  //   25,000 TPM, vs. 356,250 TPM for mistral-medium-2508 — a ~14x gap for
  //   presumably the same underlying model. That's what was causing the
  //   frequent "Rate limit exceeded" errors, not genuine overuse.
  // - mistral-medium-2508: the dated snapshot "-latest" pointed to. Same eval
  //   results as mistral-medium-latest, but without the alias's separate low
  //   quota. Metered, paid API usage.
  // - codestral-latest (current): the API key was rotated to one whose quota
  //   only covers Codestral — every chat model above (medium, small) returns
  //   "Rate limit exceeded" on it from the first request.
  model: mistral("codestral-latest"),
  // Manually maintained: bypassing the AI Gateway means eve can't look this
  // up from catalog metadata. Update if the model or its context window changes.

  // Aggressive compaction to keep context focused on current task
  compaction: {
    thresholdPercent: 0.7, // compact at 70% to prevent bloat
  },
  // No custom session limits — using eve's generous defaults. Revisit this
  // if usage volume grows, since mistral-medium-latest (unlike the previous
  // devstral-latest) is metered API usage rather than free tier.
